Description: Sparse correspondence analysis (CA) for large contingency tables, described in Ruiping Liu, Ndeye Niang-Keita, Gilbert Saporta, et al. Advances in Data Analysis and Classification.
<https://doi.org/10.1007/s11634-022-00531-5>. Sparse CA remedies to the difficulty of interpreting CA results when the size of the table is large. Since CA is a double weighted PCA or a weighted generalized SVD, we adapt here known sparse versions of these methods with specific developments to obtain orthogonal solutions and a search method for the optimal sparsity level. We distinguish two cases where sparsity is asked for both rows and columns, or only for one set.
