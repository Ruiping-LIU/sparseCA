Description: Sparse correspondence analysis (CA) for large contingency tables. Sparse CA remedies to the difficulty of interpreting CA results when the size of the table is large. Since CA is a double weighted PCA or a weighted generalized SVD, we adapt here known sparse versions of these methods with specific developments to obtain orthogonal solutions and a search method for the optimal sparsity level. We distinguish two cases where sparsity is asked for both rows and columns, or only for one set.
